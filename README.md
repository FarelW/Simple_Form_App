## Overview

Made by : [FarelW](https://github.com/FarelW)

Here is the purpose of making this project :
- To fullfil the submission from TalentGrowth technical test submission
- To make animations to enhance user experience on specific elements of a webpage
- To create a responsive form website layout that adjusts seamlessly across various devices
- To create the next screen to show all of the form data

## Built With

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)


## Explanation of Features
- `Responsive`: When designing a layout to ensure consistency and usability across various screen sizes, I prioritize a mobile-first approach combined with responsive design techniques. This involves starting with the smallest screen size, such as smartphones, and then progressively enhancing the layout for larger screens using media queries. I utilize relative units like percentages and viewport widths to ensure elements adapt fluidly to different screen sizes. Tailwind CSS's utility classes, especially those prefixed with lg: for larger screens, provide a convenient way to apply responsive design without writing custom CSS.
- `Reusable Component`: I am using reusable compoonents so that it doesnt need to be writen again
- `Show data` : After the form submitted, it will directly navigate to page where the formdata that has been filled are shown.
- `Git control system` : I am using git version control system in maintaining my project.
- `Deployment` : I am using vercel free hosting platform, to let other user experience my website easily.
